# Spring-Multi-Thread-Project
OA project with **customizable multi-threading pool** based on the Spring framework that is helpful for developers to enhance efficient,  multi-threaded file importing component with **real-time progress monitoring, multiple strategy patterns, and robust error handling**, ensuring high availability and preventing data loss.

An experimental exploratory Spring Boot frame development combined with programming in the **Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Restful**. 

Model level used Hibernate frame, Mysql as the Database, implementing separation of read and write using distributed **MySql Innodb Cluster**, resulting in a huge increase in utilization and thorough-put compared to baseline

This is a very challenging and experimental expansion project in terms of architecture and public components encapsulation. The whole project lasted almost 2 years in my previous company @Haiyi Security Technology, I really learned a lot about architecture and system design from it and thanks to my mentor and teammates! Hope you enjoy!
